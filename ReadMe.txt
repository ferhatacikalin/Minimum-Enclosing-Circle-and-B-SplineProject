The Goal Of The Project
1-In a 2-dimensional plane with integer coordinates by n user
Given N points, the minimum circumferential radius circle containing all points
plotting
2-Plot the curve that passes the closest of the given N point.
3-Calculate the radius and center of the circle you have drawn.


The following must be done in order to run the project
1-OpenGl and Glut libraries must be installed.
2-During the compilation process, the linker parameter "-lfreeglut -lopengl32" must be given."Project> Build Options> Debug> Linker Settings".
3-It will be given as input to "points.txt" file before running the program.
4-The coordinates of each point should be recorded in one line and completely in the format below.
x1 y1
x2 y2
x3 y3
Source codes are in source file.
